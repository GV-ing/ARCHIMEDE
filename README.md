# ARCHIMEDE
Archimede is an autonomous solar tracking system designed to reflect sunlight onto a specific target. It uses an Arduino Nano, DC motors, IMU, and magnetometer, integrating PID control and solar position algorithms. With low-power modes and 3D-printed parts, it optimizes energy efficiency and ensures precise operation.
