# ARCHIMEDE
Archimede is a project developed for my Bachelor's Degree thesis project in Mechatronic Engineering during my internship period at the Neabotics robotics laboratory, for the autonomous management of a solar tracking system based on DC motors, IMU sensors, and a magnetometer. The system is designed to reflect sunlight onto a specific target by dynamically adjusting the mirror's position on two axes (azimuth and elevation). Using an Arduino Nano microcontroller, the project integrates PID control algorithms, power-saving modes, and solar position calculation through astronomical libraries. The hardware features commercial aluminum components and custom parts made via 3D printing.

Key Features:

-Dynamic mirror position control.
-Low-power mode to optimize battery usage.
-Sensor integration for azimuth and elevation detection.
-PID control implementation for precise motor regulation.
-Modular and easy-to-customize system.
